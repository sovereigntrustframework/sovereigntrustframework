# Sovereign Trust Framework (STF)

### “SSI defines the actors. ToIP defines the digital trust stack. STF orchestrates the interactions where trust actually emerges.”

---

## What is STF?
The **Sovereign Trust Framework** is a **standardization & interoperability framework** for ToIP.  
It builds on:

- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** 
- **Trust over IP (ToIP)** 

STF adds the missing layer:  
**structured interactions and trust logic** that allow these actors to exchange, evaluate, and prove trust without relying on central authorities.
